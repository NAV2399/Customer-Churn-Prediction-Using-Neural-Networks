##Customer Churn Prediction using Neural Networks


📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using Neural Networks (FNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). By analyzing telecom customer data, we can identify key factors that contribute to customer churn and help businesses improve retention strategies.


🔍 Dataset Details
Dataset: Telco Customer Churn Dataset
Records: 7,043 customers
Features: 21 (tenure, contract type, payment method, etc.)
Target Variable: Churn (Yes/No)


🛠 Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
TensorFlow/Keras (Neural Networks & CNNs)
Scikit-Learn (Data Preprocessing, Train-Test Split)
Jupyter Notebook


📊 Project Workflow


✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding churn trends
✔️ Data Preprocessing: Encoding categorical features, handling missing values
✔️ Feature Engineering: Normalizing numerical variables
✔️ Model 1: Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) – Trained using TensorFlow/Keras
✔️ Model 2: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) – Used 1D convolution layers
✔️ Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC

📌 Key Insights

Short-tenure customers are more likely to churn
Month-to-month contracts have higher churn rates
Electronic check payments show a strong correlation with churn
CNNs captured deeper patterns compared to traditional FNN models
